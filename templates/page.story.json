Vintage has always inspired me — the textures, the cuts, the way every piece feels like it has a story. <br><br>Over the years, I’ve spent so much on clothing that never quite fit the way I wanted — too long, too wide, or just not right. That frustration pushed me to start creating my own pieces, designed to fit perfectly and feel just right. <br><br>My goal is to take that timeless vintage vibe and give it my own spin, blending old-school charm with a fresh, modern feel — and to offer those same well-fitting, thoughtfully made pieces to you guys too.",
